      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> My name is Molefe, and I am a passionate upcoming full stack developer with a strong interest in technology. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work in diverse roles that have helped me develop a versatile skill set and a dedicated work ethic.

        Currently, I am thriving as a Manager, where I have successfully led a team in a fast-paced environment. Not only have I effectively managed the operations and improved revenue, but I have also achieved a 5-star review on Google with over 1000 reviews. This experience has honed my leadership skills and taught me the importance of efficiency and organization.
        
        In addition to my role as a Manager, I have also worked as a House Renovations Contractor, where I excelled in conducting contractor meetings, improving process efficiency, and demonstrating exceptional management skills. This experience strengthened my problem-solving abilities and taught me the value of effective communication and teamwork.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to that, I worked as a Technical Advisor - Simulation Systems, where I successfully managed remote contracts, efficiently set up and troubleshooted simulators, and provided technical support and maintenance. This role allowed me to delve into the fascinating world of technology and develop a deep understanding of complex systems.
        
        Furthermore, I have a background in sales and accounts management. As a Sales Executive and a Sales and Accounts Manager, I excelled in building strong relationships with customers, negotiating deals, and consistently meeting sales targets. This experience taught me the importance of customer satisfaction, effective communication, and the ability to adapt to changing market demands.
        
        With my proven track record in various industries and my strong interest in technology, I am confident in my abilities to excel as a full stack developer. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in this field, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
