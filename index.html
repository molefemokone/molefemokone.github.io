      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Molefe, and I have had the pleasure of working in various roles that have allowed me to develop a diverse skill set and a strong work ethic. Currently, I am the Restaurant Manager at Plan B Restaurant, where I have successfully led a team in a high-volume, fast-paced environment. Through my strategic marketing initiatives and dedication to providing personable service, I have been able to increase revenue and achieve a 4.9, 5-star review on Google with over 1000 reviews. 

        In addition to my role as a Restaurant Manager, I have also worked as a House Renovations Contractor at MHM Resources. During my time there, I effectively conducted production and operations contractor meetings, ensuring strong communication and the ability to resolve critical issues. By implementing systems to improve process efficiency and reduce project duration, I was able to avoid construction delays and demonstrate my superb management skills.
        
        Prior to that, I worked as a Technical Advisor - Simulation Systems at E.sigma, where I managed remote contracts, set up and troubleshooted simulators, and provided technical support and maintenance. My experience also extends to my time as an Solutions Architect at Meso Group, where I established relationships with new customers, maintained contact with existing customers, and efficiently managed work quantities.
        
        Furthermore, I have experience in sales and accounts management, having worked as a Sales Executive at McCarthy Audi Menlyn and as a Sales and Accounts Manager at Core I.T Technologies. In these roles, I excelled in building relationships with customers, negotiating deals, and meeting sales targets.
        
        Overall, I possess excellent communication skills, am goal-oriented, and have a strong sales acumen. I am determined to close deals, increase business, and reach sales targets. With a proven track record in various industries, I am confident in my abilities to excel in any role I undertake.
